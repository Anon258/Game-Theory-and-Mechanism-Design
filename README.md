# Game Theory and Mechanism Design
These are my notes made during Game Theory report.

## Game Theory
This is the notes covering the first topic of Game Theory. This contains 2 sections **Non - Cooperative** and **Cooperative Game Theory**.

## Fixed Point Theorems
This is an additional content I studied to understand the proof of a theorem in Game Theory

## Mechanism Design
This is the notes for the 2nd part covering Mechanism design.
